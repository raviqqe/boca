Feature: Standard I/O

  Scenario: Check stdout
    When I successfully run `echo foo`
    Then the stdout should contain "foo"

  Scenario: Check stderr
    When I run the following script:
      """sh
      echo foo >&2
      """
    Then the stderr should contain "foo"

  Scenario: Check stdout with a blank character
    When I successfully run `echo foo`
    Then the stdout should contain "\n"

  Scenario: Check stdout to contain nothing
    When I successfully run `echo foo`
    Then the stdout should contain ""

  Scenario: Check stdout to contain exactly nothing
    When I successfully run `echo`
    Then the stdout should contain exactly ""

  Scenario: Concatenate stdout
    When I successfully run `echo foo`
    And I successfully run `echo bar`
    Then the stdout should contain exactly "foo\nbar"
    And the stdout from "echo foo" should contain exactly "foo"
    And the stdout from "echo bar" should contain exactly "bar"

  Scenario: Check output combining standard output and error
    When I run the following script:
      """sh
      echo foo
      echo bar >&2
      """
    Then the output should contain "foo"
    And the output should contain "bar"

  Scenario: Check standard error and output from a command
    When I successfully run `echo foo`
    Then the stderr from "echo foo" should not contain "foo"
    And the output from "echo foo" should contain "foo"

  Scenario: Check output from a command with a quoted argument
    When I successfully run `sh -c 'echo foo'`
    Then the stdout from "sh -c 'echo foo'" should contain exactly "foo"

  Scenario: Check output without a definite article
    When I successfully run `echo foo`
    Then stdout should contain "foo"
    And output should contain "foo"
    And stdout from "echo foo" should contain exactly "foo"

  Scenario: Check output from an interactive command
    Given a file named "foo.txt" with:
      """
      foo
      """
    When I run `cat` interactively
    And I pipe in the file "foo.txt"
    Then the stdout from "cat" should contain exactly "foo"
    And the output from "cat" should contain "foo"

  Rule: Containing strings

    Scenario: Check stdout to contain a string
      When I successfully run `echo foo bar`
      Then the stdout should contain "foo"

    Scenario: Check stdout to contain an exact string
      When I successfully run `echo foo`
      Then the stdout should contain exactly "foo"

    Scenario: Check stdout not to contain a string
      When I successfully run `echo foo`
      Then the stdout should not contain "bar"

    Scenario: Check stdout not to contain an exact string
      When I successfully run `echo foo`
      Then the stdout should not contain exactly "bar"

  Rule: Containing doc-strings

    Scenario: Check stdout to contain a string
      When I successfully run `echo foo bar`
      Then the stdout should contain:
        """
        foo
        """

    Scenario: Check stdout to contain an exact string
      When I successfully run `echo foo`
      Then the stdout should contain exactly:
        """
        foo
        """

    Scenario: Check stdout not to contain a string
      When I successfully run `echo foo`
      Then the stdout should not contain:
        """
        bar
        """

    Scenario: Check stdout not to contain an exact string
      When I successfully run `echo foo`
      Then the stdout should not contain exactly:
        """
        bar
        """
